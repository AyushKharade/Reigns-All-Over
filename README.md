# New mechanic: Archery
This mechanic was added after the prototype demo video was uploaded:

This is an attempt to recreate archery mechanics like Tomb Raider (2012), where you can draw your bow longer for higher damage.

This video only shows the archery mechanic.

# Notes
- Latest updated branch is Polished_Archery, which has not been merged into master.
- The world in this prototype is built using assets from Unity asset store which are huge in size and not pushed on to repository. These files are on my Unity account and my local computer so you will not be able to access the world if you clone this repo.
